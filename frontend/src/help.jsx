      <Paragraph>Encountering cigarette stubs when going outside, especially in cities, is a sad guarantee of our modern day.
        They hide in every nook and cranny: cobbled surfaces, sideways of paths, or drains. Communes spend about 225 million Euros every year to deal with the clean up. Furthermore, they pollute our waters or kill animals who mistake them for food. 
        No more! Upload your findings of stubs via the camera icon to share the location with the ones who want to clean them up. They can be ordinary citizens or town cleanup. For an optimal route for a limited time frame, click on "Route". 
        Based on factors like number of reports at a spot, and a spot's nearness to nature, an urgency score is calculated. 
        Helpers will be guided to high urgency spots during their routes. Once a spot was cleaned, just click the "Cleaned" button! Don't forget to dispose the stubs in ash trays, they don't belong in the general waste.
        Companies like TobaCycle which recycle the stubs are willing to pick them up for free.
